# petri
A game/simulation written in javascript.

I wrote this project in 2015 as the final assignment for Khan Academy's summer of code. This project contains the origional code in petri.js (plus some bug fixes) as well as an html wrapper which allows it to be viewed in a browser.

The origional project can be viewed on khan academy at https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/cellular-survival/5878236081946624
